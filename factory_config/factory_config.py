"""
This script can be used to
    * create JSON file with application TLV data to be programmed to the static section (SS)
    * convert JSON type/value pairs to binary TLV
    * insert TLVs into the SS area of a hex file,
    * just dump the SS from the hex file.
There are pearl and python versions of the file.

Usage factory_config.py [hex file] [json file] [-tv:<name>:<type>:<value>] [-20706A2]

If only hex file name is provided, the tool prints the TLVs in the SS section.
Note that the -20706A2 flag is necessary to tell the tool to use the 20706 style of TLV,
otherwise it defaults to the TLV style used for 20735B1, 20739B2, 20819A1, or 43012C0...
If hex file already contains application TLVs the printout will display both original
and application TLVs.

If only the JSON file is provided, the tool prints the hex TLV that would be generated.

If only one or several -tv structures are included, the tool prints the JSON file that would be generated

If one or several -tv tripplets are included and JSON file is preovided, the tool creates the JSON file
that inlcudes array of Name/Type/Value objects. For example
    factory_config_json.py -tv:static_oob_data:e1:000102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f

If HEX file and JSON file are included, the tool merges data from the JSON into the static section of the
hex file. Note that if hex files contained application TLVs those will be replaced with the
TLVs specified in the json file.

If HEX file and array of TLVs are included, the tool merges TLV information into the static section
of the hex file. Note that if hex files contained application TLVs those will be replaced with the
TLVs specified in the command line.

Example:
factory_config.py light_dimmable-CYW920719Q40EVB_01-rom-ram-Wiced-release.hex  -tv:uuid:e1:b9fe1e3a278b4437a66f59cc74b6cf86
